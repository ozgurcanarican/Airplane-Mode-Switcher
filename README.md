# AIRPLANE MODE SWITCHER

Airplane Mode Switcher allows you to switch airplane mode on/off remotely on android devices

There are some requirements for running the program without any trouble:

	1)SDK must be installed on your computer, and it must be added in system path.

	2)Your android device must be connected to your computer with a data transfer cable.

	3)On your android device, find the developer options from settings and turn it on. Also turn the USB debugging on.

	  This will allow your computer access to your android device.
	  
	  The GIF below, shows how to turn on "developer options" and "USB debugging" in some android devices.

  After program runs properly, you will have two choice for switching airplane mode:

	1)Switch Manually:

	  You can switch on by typing "o" and off by typing "x" and quit the program by typing "q"
